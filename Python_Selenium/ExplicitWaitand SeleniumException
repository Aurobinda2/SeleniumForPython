Expected Conditions:
There are some frequently encountered conditions when automating Web Browsers for Testing Web/Mobile Applications. The Java, C# and Python bindings include those convenient methods so we donâ€™t have to write-up an ExpectedCondition class ourselves or create our own utility package for them. Some of the Expected Conditions are:

alertIsPresent()
elementToBeClickable(locator)
elementToBeSelected(WebElement)
frameToBeAvailableAndSwitchToIt(locator)
invisibilityOf(element)


So your Automation Script may be facing any of these exceptions:

NoSuchElementException
TimeoutException
ElementNotVisibleException
ElementNotSelectableException
